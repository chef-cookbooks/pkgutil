# Configuration file for pkgutil

# $Id: pkgutil.conf 448 2012-02-04 14:22:21Z bonivart $

# Master configuration file is placed in /opt/csw/etc. Place a pkgutil.conf
# file in /etc/opt/csw if you want a local override setting-by-setting.

# Nothing below is mandatory to change, pkgutil will use the default values 
# noted below for each option unless something is uncommented.

# Catalog not cached
# Tells your proxy server to disable caching during fetching
# of the catalog and descriptions.
# Default: true
#catalog_not_cached=true

# Catalog update interval
# Number of days between automatic catalog updates. Special cases are -1
# if you want to disable automatic updates and 0 if you always want to
# update the catalog.
# Default: 14
#catalog_update=14

# Filter out CSWcommon from --deptree output
# Set this to true if you don't want to see lots of lines with CSWcommon.
# Default: false
#deptree_filter_common=true

# Exclude pattern
# Space separated list of simple patterns that will exclude matching packages
# when updating or installing.
# Default: blank
#exclude_pattern=

# gpg homedir
# The path to the gpg directory (instead of ~/.gnupg) when verifying the
# catalogs integrity.
# NOTE: we recommend you install the CSWcswpki package for
#       easiest handling of the keys
# Default: blank
#gpg_homedir=

# Max package list length
# During dependency calculation the recursive algorithm needs to be protected
# against cyclic dependencies in the catalog (packages that list each other
# as dependencies) or pkgutil will not stop until memory is exhausted.
# Default: 100000
#maxpkglist=100000

# Mirror to use for downloads
# See http://www.opencsw.org/mirrors for alternative mirrors.
# NOTE: remember to include distribution (e.g. testing) at the end of the url.
# NOTE: you can have multiple mirrors by defining multiple mirror lines.
# Default: http://mirror.opencsw.org/opencsw/testing
#mirror=http://mirror.opencsw.org/opencsw/testing

# Support non-CSW packages
# If you have your own packages that have a different prefix that you want
# to use with pkgutil you must enable this otherwise pkgutil will skip every
# package not prefixed by CSW.
# NOTE: this also affects options like -c/C, however it's easy to filter the
#       output if wanted, e.g. "pkgutil -C CSW".
# Default: false
#noncsw=true

# Options to use for pkgadd
# You can set it to -S to skip displaying the license during install.
# Solaris 10: If you wish to limit pkgutil to installing packages
#             only to the global zone, set it to -G. Note that pkgrm
#             does not have the same option.
# WARNING: do not modify this unless you know what you're doing.
# Default: blank
#pkgaddopts=-G -S

# Style of package list when installing/upgrading packages
# 0 is the one used since the first version of pkgutil, it's space efficient
# but less readable. 1 is the one introduced in v1.7, it's one package per
# line which is easier to read. 2 is the same as 1 but also displays which
# distribution a package comes from, e.g. unstable or stable.
# Default: 2
#pkgliststyle=2

# Options to use for pkgrm
# Solaris 10: If you wish to limit pkgutil to removing packages
#             only in the global zone, set it to -O nozones.
# WARNING: do not modify this unless you know what you're doing.
# Default: blank
#pkgrmopts=-O nozones

# Root path to use
# WARNING: do not modify this unless you know what you're doing.
# Default: /
#root_path=/a

# Show the current list of packages or not
# You can choose to not show the list of current packages to get less output
# when doing operations.
# Default: true
#show_current=true

# How to handle soft errors from hooks that are called
# A hook that exits with code 1 will cause pkgutil to stop. If this value is
# true, exit code 2 will also cause pkgutil to stop. Exit code 2 is a non-fatal
# error condition from a hook and it is a site dependent choice whether or
# not to honour this condition. Set to true to enable.
# Default: false
#stop_on_hook_soft_error=false

# Use of gpg, md5
# To enable use of gpg or md5, uncomment these
# NOTE: it doesn't make sense to use md5 but not gpg so your options should be:
#       1. both disabled, 2. gpg enabled, 3. both enabled.
# Default: false, false
#use_gpg=true
#use_md5=true

# Options to use for wget
# You can also use any option from wgetrc with --execute, e.g.
# "--execute http_proxy=http://proxy.foo.bar".
# WARNING: do not modify this unless you know what you're doing.
# Default: blank
#wgetopts=-U pkgutil
